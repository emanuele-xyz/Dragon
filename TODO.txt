[x] When fragment gets a lot of directional lighting, with high ambient it looks a bit too much saturated
[x] Maybe merge lit and unlit shaders? (Just use an object constant flag is_lit for example)
[x] Experiment with new shading model

[ ] (M) Support soldier picking and moving
[ ] Ray-AABB intersection
[ ] Build AABB from mesh data
[x] Draw AABB (wireframe)
[x] AABB rendering is not quite right
[x] Support base color + blend factor for lit and unlit
[x] Merge lit and unlit pixel shaders

[ ] I have discovered some strange bug where the input gets stuck. I dunno why. Maybe ImGui capture and mouse state tracking?

[ ] Integrate texture and mesh management with ECS. Make it so that resources are loaded based on what components are attached to entities inside the scene. There is an initial pass that loads the referenced resources in bulk (async). Then, at each iteration, we check whether appropriately for new resources to be loaded (async).

[ ] (S) Build level editor
[ ] (S) Build resource importer (texture, mesh, audio ...)
[ ] (S) Build entity editor
[ ] (S) Build terrain editor

[x] Update readme
[ ] Make repo public

[ ] Finish sorting out DragonDebug and DragonRelease property sheets <-- IMPORTANT
