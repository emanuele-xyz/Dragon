[ ] When fragment gets a lot of directional lighting, with high ambient it looks a bit too much saturated
[ ] Maybe merge lit and unlit shaders? (Just use an object constant flag is_lit for example)

[ ] (M) Support soldier picking and moving
[ ] Ray-AABB intersection
[ ] Build AABB from mesh data
[ ] Draw AABB (wireframe)
[ ] Support base color + blend factor for lit and unlit
